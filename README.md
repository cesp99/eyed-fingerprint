## Disclaimer

This is my first Next.js app, so it may not have the polish or perfection you'd expect from a fully production-ready project.\
I created this app as a personal experiment to dive into Next.js, learn about web development, and explore privacy protection technologies.\
My goal was to tinker with new technologies, improve my skills, and build something functional.
